        `Managed to reduce 400 SDE hours/year of manually testing by implementing an E2E and Canary IaaS testing framework using Cypress.io and AWS services that allow the deployment pipelines to become full CI/CD, thus reducing deployment time and ensuring that high quality code is delivered to the production environments.
        Implemented an alarming and logging system that notifies the development team about problems before they reached our key stakeholders. This allowed the achievement of a 99.9% SLA and increased overall customer satisfaction.
        Successfully integrated both old-gen (LPT) and new-gen (CDK) AWS Cloud infrastructure in the same cloudframework for both the FE and BE pipelines, thus optimizing resources allocation and lowering billable monthly costs by half.

        The testing was done in various environments, including web and cloud applications hosted on hybrid cloud architecture.
        After the thorough analysis of error logs and external dependencies, through my constant feedback, the team managed to decrease in 2 months the bug rate by 3x, having an overall error rate of under 2%.
